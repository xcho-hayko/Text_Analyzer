As an object-oriented language, C++ provides facilities for using objects and for writing object blueprints, called classes. You can certainly write programs in C++ without classes and objects, but by doing so, you do not take advantage of the most fundamental and useful aspect of the language; writing a C++ program without classes is like traveling to Paris and eating at McDonald’s. To use classes and objects effectively, you must understand their syntax and capabilities.
Chapter 1, “A Crash Course in C++ and the Standard Library,” reviewed the basic syntax of class definitions. Chapter 5, “Designing with Objects,” introduced the object-oriented approach to programming in C++ and presented specific design strategies for classes and objects.
